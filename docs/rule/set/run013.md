# Rule RUN013

## Definition

pdate the package manager before installing packages.
## Description
Package manager update ensures that the packages are up to date, regardless of when the image was built.


## Solution


 &#x1F7E2; &nbsp; Add the update command before the package install command.

### Example
* debian-based base images:
```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends vim
```
Running both commands in one RUN statement limits the number of layers built.
