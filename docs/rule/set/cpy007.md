# Rule CPY007

## Definition
`COPY . .` or `COPY . <destination path>`, copies the complete context directory, which may end up copying sensitive 
files to the image file system.



## Description
`COPY` command is used to copy contents from the context directory to the image file system.
This context directory contains the Dockerfile, along with the application source code, configuration files, and other
necessary files for the application. In case of recursive copy, the entire context folder gets copied
which may end up copying sensitive files as well.

## Recommendation
* Avoid recursive copy, and explicitly define the directories or files that should be copied.
* Do not copy the entire build context folder to image.
* Use `.dockerignore` to avoid copying confidential files.

## Examples


 &#x1F7E2; &nbsp; The following command recursively copies the entire build context to `/dst` folder in the docker image.

```Dockerfile
COPY . /dst
```


 &#x1F534; &nbsp; The recommended way would be,

```Dockerfile
COPY ./src /dst
```
