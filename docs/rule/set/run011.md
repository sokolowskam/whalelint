# Rule RUN011

## Definition

Generating keys in the build phase renders the keys static. Consider mounting the keys at runtime instead.

## Description

Command `ssh-keygen` generates a pair of keys consisting of a public and a private one. When they are generated 
in the image build hase, they remain exactly the same in all containers created from that image. As a result, these keys are available to everybody who pulls the image.



## Solution


 &#x1F7E2; &nbsp; Instead of generating the keys in the build phase (when running `docker build`), mount them during runtime instead (using the parameter `-v` in the `docker run` command)

### Example
* generate the keys on your host
```
ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -N "passphrase" -f ~/id_rsa
```
* run the container with mounted keys
```
docker run -dit -v ~/id_rsa:/home/user/id_rsa ubuntu:22.04
```
this way your keys are separated from your image and can be changed without the need to rebuild the container.
