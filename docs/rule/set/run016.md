# Rule RUN016

## Definition

Consider checking the checksum of every file you download. Assuming the source of the download provides a checksum, you can assert the authenticity of the downloaded file.

## Description

When downloading files from the Internet (eg. via wget) there is always a risk of falling a victim to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where the adversary pretends to be the source of the download and sends fabricated content.
A way to detect it is to check the checksum of the desired file with the checksum of the downloaded file. In this case, it is important to know the correct checksum or hash before creating the Dockerfile - creators of packages often provide them on their websites.



## Example
* check the checksum provided by the package creator
```
RUN gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net \ 
--recv-keys 7937DFD2AB06298B2293C3187D33FF9D0246406D \
                        114F43EE0176B71C7BC219DD50A3051F888C628D
ENV NODE_VERSION 0.10.38
ENV NPM_VERSION 2.10.0
RUN curl -SLO "http://nodejs.org/dist/v$NODE_VERSION/node-v\
$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz" \ 
&& curl -SLO "http://nodejs.org/dist/v$NODE_VERSION/\
SHASUMS256.txt.asc" \ 
&& gpg --verify SHASUMS256.txt.asc \ 
&& grep " node-v$NODE_VERSION-linux-x64.tar.gz\$" \
            SHASUMS256.txt.asc | sha256sum -c - 
```
* generate the checksum in case none is provided
```
sha1sum -b node.tar.gz
```
