# Rule RUN015

## Definition

o not hardcode the private key in the Dockerfile. Consider instead to mount it on runtime.
## Description

Command `ssh-keygen` generates a pair of keys consisting of a public and a private one. When they are generated
in the image build phase, they remain exactly the same in all containers created from that image. As a result, these keys are available to everybody who pulls the image.



## Solution


&#x1F7E2; &nbsp; Instead of generating the keys in the build phase (when running `docker build`), mount them during runtime instead (using the parameter `-v` in the `docker run` command)

### Example
* generate the keys on your host
```
ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -N "passphrase" -f ~/id_rsa
```
* run the container with mounted keys
```
docker run -dit -v ~/id_rsa:/home/user/id_rsa ubuntu:22.04
```
this way your keys are separated from your image and can be changed without the need to rebuild the container.
