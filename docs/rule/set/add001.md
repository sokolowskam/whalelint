# Rule ADD001

## Definition

Use `COPY` instead of `ADD` for simple tasks like directory duplication.


## Description

Although `ADD` and `COPY` offer some similar functionalities, it is advised to use COPY for simple file duplication tasks. 
`COPY` only offers basic copy mechanisms, whereas `ADD` command allows multiple other functionalities like automatic 
decompression and URL support. Because of having so many features, `ADD` commands can be unpredictable. 
`COPY` command is more straightforward and safer to use.
So, if your task involves only copying local files to the container, and does not need any added functionalities like 
decompression or URL support, then it is recommended to use `COPY`. `ADD` can be used when we need both auto-extraction of 
local files and duplication of these files to container.



## Examples


 &#x1F7E2; &nbsp; If you only need to copy the `/src` directory from your local file system to `/dst` directory in the image, then use,

```Dockerfile
COPY ./src /dst
```


 &#x1F534; &nbsp; Do not use,

```Dockerfile
ADD ./src /dst
```
