1) no package manager upgrade (might be bad bc upgrade fixes any vulnerabilities that might be in past versions of the packages):  /(apt-get (-y\s)?upgrade)/igm   /(apk\supgrade)/igm
2) less checksum lines than downloads: /((curl|wget|torrent).*http(s?):\/\/.*)(sha1sum|sha224sum|sha384sum|sha256sum|sha512sum|md5sum|hmac|base64)/igms
3) hardcoded credentials: /(−− password)/igm  /(password|token|secret|client_secret)/igm   
4) key generation during image build: /RUN(.*)(ssh\-keygen)\s\-(.*)$/igm
5) static private key: /(PRIVATE KEY −−−−−)/igm
6) sudo without password:  /(\/etc\/sudoers)/igm
7) not switching to a non-root user:  /^USER\s+((?!root).*)(:.*)?$/gm
